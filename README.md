# Python_Projects
Description:
This Python script automates the organization of files within a specified directory. It categorizes files into two subfolders, "image files" and "pdf files," based on their file extensions (e.g., .png and .pdf). If these subfolders don't exist, the script creates them. Files are moved into the appropriate subfolder, ensuring a neat and structured file system.
